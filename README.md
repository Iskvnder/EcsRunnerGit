# EcsRunnerGit

# Description
The project is a game of HowRunner. In this file we provide information about the project, its structure and decisions made.

# Project history
At the beginning of the development we used another repository with the initial project and planned to use Git Flow to organize the work on the project. However, based on our experience working on previous projects, we encountered problems with losing the project as a result of not using Git Flow correctly.

Based on this experience, we decided to change our approach to project development. Instead of using Git Flow entirely, we decided to divide responsibilities among team members to work more efficiently. Abdullah focuses on developing and improving the core gameplay (cor gameplay) and transitioning to the new architecture. At the same time, I am responsible for the user interface development (UI/UX) and the visual design of the game (Art Design).

This decision was made in order to increase the efficiency of each team member. It allows us to focus on our areas of expertise and achieve intermediate results faster. It also allows us to track changes more easily and combine our work into the final result.
